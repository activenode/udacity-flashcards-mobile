This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

Run this with expo by simply calling:

`yarn start`

EXPLANATION OF THE WORK:
This work was done as part of the Udacity React Course.

With focus on GTD and some on-top additions in terms of Animation it
was made by creating the storage api first then creating all the view logic
decoupled from the storage-api and only THEN connecting all together.
